# Coarse_grain
Coarse grain to all atom conversion

The pupose of the project is to convert a coarse grained representation of system (e.g. DNA and Protein) to an all atom system representaion.
We will start with a coarse grain coordinate file of DNA (more specifically 3SPN - 3 beads per nucleotide).
For protein the coarse grained file contains C-alpha cordinated only.
